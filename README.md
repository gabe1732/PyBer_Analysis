- Although ride shares are more popular in an urban setting from a drivers presepctive they make more money per ride in rural cities 55.48 per ride vs urban cities 16.57 per ride
- The amount of revenue per fare could be higher in Rural areas for several reason.  In this analysis it shows there is less competition amongst drivers as there is not a lot rural drivers but also something that can be attributed to the high fare in rural areas could be the duration of the rides.

## Summary
In conclusion it seems there is a lot of opportunities in rural cities.  The driver incentives are high since there is less competition and the average fare is much higher for rural drivers.  Something that should be added to the this analysis is the duration of the rides.  This will help determine how much drivers are making per mile which could help determine the actual profitablity of each ride.
